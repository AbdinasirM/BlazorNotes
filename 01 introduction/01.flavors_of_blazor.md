# Blazor Overview

Blazor is a framework for building interactive web applications using C# instead of JavaScript. It offers two hosting models: **Blazor Server** and **Blazor WebAssembly**. Each model has distinct features, benefits, and trade-offs that make them suitable for different use cases.

## Blazor Server
Blazor Server renders the application on the server-side and sends updates to the client using SignalR. This allows for real-time interaction and efficient communication, but it requires a constant connection to the server.

### Key Features:
- **Server-Side Rendering**: All logic and rendering happen on the server.
- **Lightweight on the Client**: The browser only receives HTML and binary updates.
- **Real-Time Communication**: Uses SignalR for live updates.

### Pros:
- Fast initial load time (no large framework to download).
- Ideal for apps requiring server-side processing or secure environments.
- Centralized logic and resource management.

### Cons:
- Requires a stable, high-quality network connection.
- Increased server resource demand as every client connection consumes server memory and processing power.

### Example:
```csharp
@page "/counter"

<h3>Counter</h3>

<p>Current count: @currentCount</p>

<button @onclick="IncrementCount">Click me</button>

@code {
    private int currentCount = 0;

    private void IncrementCount()
    {
        currentCount++;
    }
}
```
In this example, the **Counter** component updates the count value on the server and sends the changes to the client.

## Blazor WebAssembly
Blazor WebAssembly (WASM) runs your application directly in the browser. It leverages WebAssembly to execute C# code on the client-side, making the application independent of the server after the initial load.

### Key Features:
- **Client-Side Execution**: Runs completely in the browser.
- **Standalone**: Works independently after loading, making it ideal for Progressive Web Apps (PWAs).
- **ASP.NET Hosting Option**: Can be hosted by an ASP.NET Core backend for additional features like API calls.

### Pros:
- No constant server connection required.
- Offloads computation to the client, reducing server resource usage.
- Offline support (with Progressive Web Apps).

### Cons:
- Larger initial load time due to downloading the framework and application files.
- Limited by browser capabilities and resources.
- May encounter compatibility challenges on older browsers.

### Example:
```csharp
@page "/fetchdata"

<h3>Weather forecast</h3>

@if (forecasts == null)
{
    <p><em>Loading...</em></p>
}
else
{
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Date</th>
                <th>Temperature (Â°C)</th>
                <th>Summary</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            @foreach (var forecast in forecasts)
            {
                <tr>
                    <td>@forecast.Date.ToShortDateString()</td>
                    <td>@forecast.TemperatureC</td>
                    <td>@forecast.Summary</td>
                </tr>
            }
        </tbody>
    </table>
}

@code {
    private WeatherForecast[] forecasts;

    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
    {
        forecasts = await Http.GetFromJsonAsync<WeatherForecast[]>("weatherforecast");
    }
}
```
This example fetches weather data from an API and displays it in the browser.

## Choosing Between Blazor Server and Blazor WebAssembly
| Feature                     | Blazor Server           | Blazor WebAssembly      |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Rendering**              | Server-side            | Client-side            |
| **Network Dependency**     | High                   | Low (after loading)    |
| **Performance**            | Server-dependent       | Client-dependent       |
| **Initial Load Time**      | Fast                   | Slower (downloads app) |
| **Offline Support**        | No                     | Yes (with PWAs)        |
| **Resource Usage**         | High on Server         | High on Client         |
